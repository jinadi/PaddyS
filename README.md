# Paddy Statistics



**Introduction & Motivation:**

Rice is the staple food of the inhabitants of Sri Lanka. Paddy crops are cultivated as a wetland crop in all the districts. The total land devoted for paddy is estimated to be about 708,000 Hectares at present. There are two cultivation seasons namely; Maha and Yala which are synonymous with two monsoons. Maha Season falls during the North-east monsoon from September to March in the following year. The Yala season is effective during the period from May to the end of August. When the crop is sown and harvested during above periods, the particular season is defined. However, the whole area devoted to paddy is not being cultivated due to a number of reasons such as shortage of water during the seasons, prevailing unsettled conditions on the ground, etc. 

Paddy extent: Paddy extent namely, Asweddumized (land prepared for cultivation), sown, and harvested on a complete enumeration basis was commenced in 1951. This method of data collection has since been continued each season with the active cooperation of the Agricultural Research and Production Assistants (A.R.P.O)/Grama Niladari (GN) who are acting as primary reporters.
Average yield of paddy: Average yield of paddy in Sri Lanka at district level is estimated by means of a sample survey which is popularly known as the crop cutting survey initiated with the assistance of FAO in 1951. At present a sample of 3,000 villages for the main season (Maha) and 2,000 villages for the second season (Yala) are selected to carry out experiments.
Paddy production: Estimate of paddy production is obtained for each season as a product of the acreage harvested and the average yield.

Currently this survey is conducted using a paper based questionnaire collection method which is carried out by the Grama Niladhari/ Agricultural Research and Production Assistants / Statistical Assistants/ Statistical Officers.
